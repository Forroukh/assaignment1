        <div class="webquotes"> <h3>“A successful website does three things:
            It attracts the right kinds of visitors. 
            Guides them to the main services or product you offer.
            Collect Contact details for future ongoing relation.”
            ― Mohamed Saad</h3> </div>
        <div class=" webquotes"> <h3>“We love what we do and we do what our clients love & work with great clients all over the world to create thoughtful and purposeful websites.”
            ― ProWeb365</h3> </div>
        <div class=" webquotes"> <h3>“Your website is the center of your digital eco-system,  like a brick and mortar location, the experience matters once a customer enters,  just as much as the perception they have of you before they walk through the door.”
            ― Leland Dieno</h3></div>
            <div class=" webquotes"> <h3>“An individual block of code takes moments to write, minutes or hours to debug, and can last forever without being touched again. It’s when you or someone else visits code written yesterday or ten years ago that having code written in a clear, consistent style becomes extremely useful. Understandable code frees mental bandwidth from having to puzzle out inconsistencies, making it easier to maintain and enhance projects of all sizes.”
                ― Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Audrey Roy Greenfeld</h3></div>
                <div class=" webquotes"> <h3>“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.”
